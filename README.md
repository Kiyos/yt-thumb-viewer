# YouTube Thumbnail Viewer

## WTF is this about
Some YouTube videos out there have pretty interesting and cool previews, making me want to have a closer look on them. So, for a while, I was figuring out and typing in their URLs by hand. Eventually I grew tired of that and decided to make a web app (more like a webpage, really).

The reason I made this specifically a web app is that I wanted to expand my basic knowlende of HTML, to learn how to utilize CSS and Javascript, and to get acquainted with some of the modern web development technologies, techniques, and libraries.

## How to run
The app is designed to be run locally, i.e. by just double-clicking `index.html`, but I’m pretty sure that it can be served over LAN or Internet as-is, without any changes to codebase.

## Internals
* HTML5
* Javascript
* Bootstrap 3.3.7
* JQuery 1.12.4

Everything is being used as effective and as correctly as possible (to the extent of my knowledge). What I didn’t do, however, is make sure that all of this works in all of the browsers in the world, including outdated ones. Maybe some day I’ll look into that.
